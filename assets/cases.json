Positium positions itself between the client and mobile network operator to analyze Big Data of mobile phone locations, providing clients with faster and more cost-effective analysis based on a large population rather than a sample. There are multiple domains where such data is directly relevant. The objective of the business plan is to conduct domain-specific market research, assess the requirements for development of the technology and specify the business model for Positium Data Mediator – a product to extract, process and deliver the insights from mobile big data to users globally. At current stage, Positium Data Mediator works in Estonia in domains like urban planning, transportation planning, geo-marketing, tourism statistics. Positium is transforming from a global market leader in its home market to a global player in multiple markets in the EU and emerging countries. The business plan will be vital to narrow down the focus for expansion and determine strategies to pick the low-hanging fruit. In the business plan, the selection of domains, geographical regions and development requirements will be investigated using surveys and interviews among potential customers, market research and financial calculations. The outcome of the business plan is a recommendation on the geographic expansion, business model and the need for technology development, and a business plan.",

        "description": "Urban environments are awash with data from fixed and mobile sensors and monitoring infrastructures from public, private, or industry sources. Making such data useful would enable developing novel big data applications to benefit the citizens of Europe in areas such as transportation, infrastructures, and crime prevention. Urban data is heterogeneous, noisy, and unlabeled, which severely reduces its usability. The goal of the VaVel project is to radically advance our ability to use urban data in applications that can identify and address citizen needs and improve urban life. Our motivation comes from problems in urban transportation. This project will develop a general purpose framework for managing and mining multiple heterogeneous urban data streams for cities become more efficient, productive and resilient. The framework will be able to solve major issues that arise with urban transportation related data and are currently not dealt by existing stream management technologies. The project brings together two European cities that provide diverse large scale data of cross-country origin and real application needs, three major European companies in this space, and a strong group of researchers that have uniquely strong expertise in analyzing real-life urban data. VaVel aims at making fundamental advances in addressing the most critical inefficiencies of current (big) data management and stream frameworks to cope with emerging urban sensor data thus making European urban data more accessible and easy to use and enhancing European industries that use big data management and analytics. The consortium develops end-user driven concrete scenaria that are addressing real, important problems with the potential of enormous impact, and a large spectrum of technology requirements, thus enabling the realization of the fundamental capabilities required and the realistic evaluation of the success of our methods.",

        "description": "Transportation authorities use real-time traffic data for everyday urban transport management, and analyse commuters’ origin and destination points for infrastructure and transit planning. However, intelligent transport systems that provide real-time data cost millions of euros for road sensor deployment. GPS aggregators like Google Maps and Inrix are inexpensive but can miss up to 50% of real time traffic jams, and do not represent population segments proportionally, which is essential to transportation planning. Cellular network location data is now ubiquitous and cheap, but it is imprecise due to the range of cellular antenna coverage. Cellint uses artificial intelligence algorithms to process cellular network location data for optimized transportation management. Their patented technology tracks phones on a mobile network passively and anonymously, pinpointing their locations on any mode of transportation. The result is a virtual sensor network that provides real-time sensor-quality traffic data at a fraction of the cost of sensor systems. The project is to upgrade and integrate current solutions into a single automated transportation information platform with advanced analysis and visualization features, with results provided in minutes instead of months.",

The Vehicle sharing operators are the prime customers of SMASH. They are proliferating worldwide, but their deployed systems are currently characterized by poor interoperability, service coverage restricted to the center of the cities, and poor capability to dynamically extend fleets. Peer-to-peer (P2P) vehicle-sharing is a key market for SMASH. P2P is a process expanding worldwide, whereby existing vehicle owners make their vehicles available for others to rent for short periods of time. The participating car owners are able to charge a fee to rent out their vehicles when they are not using them. The Participating renters can access nearby and affordable vehicles and pay only a convenient fee, for the time they need to use them. SMASH, bringing the two parties together enables a global expanding community of users and available resources. SMASH enables Open Source vehicle sharing. In the next future, thanks to SMASH users will be able to choose and access a wide and expanding range of vehicles, with a smart access and reliable pay-per-use. Many heterogeneous and interoperable vehicles will be connected and available in sharing.",

TiMMi works together with bike courier partners in the 25 largest German cities, who are the backbone of the transporter community. TiMMi is also working to exploit unused transportation capacity by enabling private individuals to sign up as transporters & take on jobs on a casual basis. Private individuals add capacity to the delivery network, whilst avoiding an increase in CO2-emissions for deliveries, even if transported by car, given that packages travel on a route which would be travelled anyway. With the TiMMi system, bike couriers can receive orders from an online form or via facebook Messenger, as well as via integrations in online shop check-out processes whereby customers can directly choose the CO2-free express delivery option for their purchase.

        "description": "In Europe, 70% of commuters drive a car to go to work. In 90% of cases, regardless of the geographical area, the occupation ratio of the car is 1:1. In the Paris region alone, this means that there are 40M seats that remain unused every day. Whilst, governments are focusing on spelling out policies to develop more sustainable urban mobility grids, the stunning success and strong growth of carpooling service websites, such as BlablaCar, Europe’s leader on long distance carpooling signals that the sharing-economy heralds a shift in consumer attitudes and could provide a solution to sustainable intra-city mobility. Yet, current solutions to facilitate are pooling are not-adapted to intra-city commutes. They are Geared to the Long-distance, Non-Intelligent/Automated, Inflexible and lacking critical mass: and Non-transparent. KAROS is a smart mobility platform, leveraging big data technologies, Artificial Intelligence and algorithms. KAROS operates in an indirect model to reach its end-users, by striking partnerships with companies which partly subsidise the service, in order to offer more convenient and comfortable means of transportation to their employees, at lower costs. Since January 2016, with no marketing, KAROS counts over 25K users, 3600 of whom are active on a weekly basis.",

Working with three cities to address societal problems linked to smart mobility and urban planning, the intention is to enable public administrations to respond to urban challenges by enriching the policy making process with opportunities for policy experimentation at three different steps of the policy cycle (policy design, policy implementation, and policy evaluation). Experimentation of policy options will enable the cities to tackle complex, systemic policy problems that require innovative thinking to develop transformative solutions.",

The FABULOS PCP goal is to push the market to creation of smart systems for the management of autonomous electric bus fleet operations and related services, in urban environments. This sort of intelligent transportation systems and integrated transportation approaches, are key to enable a sustainable development of public transportation and for cities to be able to become car free in a foreseeable future. The robotic bus technology is fast approaching its market readiness stage; however current transportation systems are not equipped to deal with such type of transportation. In order to capitalize on the potential of autonomous buses, cities should combine efforts in pushing the market to develop system solutions capable of bridging autonomous bus technologies and the cities public transportation systems, helping them to become smarter in the process, and also helping to open up demand for the autonomous vehicles industry.",

For the most granular product also other socio-economic parameters are available. It has been shown that information derived from Eorth Observation Data significantly improves existing census data through a modelling approach based on land cover and land use information. Thereby, AgeSpot links Earth Observation derived population density with state-of-the art demographic models. The unique approach not only provides spatially explicit demographic data along with information on education and others, but also allows long-term forecasting at different levels of granularity. AgeSpot creates a new market and value network by offering a “one-stop-shop” for spatially explicit population and demographic data available. Customers do not need to arduously assemble and analyse different sources of external data but AgeSpot enables them to access standardized key information with already integrated external data information and improve the existing data situation in many innovative ways.",

Also to develop a cascade planning model (territorial organisation plans, master plans, town plans and management plans) based on a new concept and basic common information. The SITxell project promotes the use of the information related to territorial analysis (geology, hydrology, botany, zoology, ecology, socio-economics, agronomy, town planning) both from independent groups of experts (university research centres, private consultants social organisations, etc.) and inside the administration itself for the socioeconomic development compatible with the preservation of ecosystem services essential for the maintenance of human welfare. Nowadays, we are channelling these planning purposes through the implementation of green infrastructure at local and regional scales. The ultimate aim is to transform this expert information into knowledge that can easily be applied to territorial analysis, planning and management, to be used by all competent public administrations. So, the application of a concept and common information at the different levels and areas of territorial organisation promotes governability through concurrent, agreed planning mechanisms and substantially increases the effectiveness of public administration and the sustainable use of the territory.",

A methodology to perform energy simulations predicting energy heat demand at building level, based on the use of SimStadt software and input data consisting of CityGML 3D building data and weather data, has been applied in four test city areas in three Member States and thoroughly documented. A comparative analysis of the simulation results has been done, aiming at providing insight into the following aspects:(1) identify the main obstacles to find and pre-process the input data required by the simulations, including the need to adapt to local contexts the building physical library used by the simulation software, (2) identify the main factors influencing the accuracy of the simulation results,(3) estimate the influence of the accuracy of the CityGML LoD of the input data on the accuracy of the simulations results, (4)identify the main sources of mismatch to be considered when comparing the simulation results with real energy consumption data.",

        "description": "Currently within the EU’s Earth Observation (EO) monitoring framework, there is a need for low-cost methods for acquiring high quality in-situ data to create accurate and well-validated environmental monitoring products. The aim of the LandSense project is to build a far reaching citizen observatory for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) monitoring that will also function as a technology innovation marketplace. LandSense will deploy advanced tools, services and resources to mobilize and engage citizens to collect in-situ observations (i.e. ground-based data and visual interpretations of EO imagery). Integrating these citizen-driven in-situ data collections with established authoritative and open access data sources will help reduce costs, extend GEOSS and Copernicus capacities, and support comprehensive environmental monitoring systems. New LandSense services will be deployed in three demonstration cases that will address critical LULC issues in the areas of urbanization, agricultural land use and forest/habitat monitoring. Policy-relevant campaigns will be implemented in close collaboration with multiple stakeholders to ensure that citizen observations contribute to EU-wide environmental governance and decision-making. There will be numerous pathways to citizen empowerment via the LandSense Engagement Platform, i.e. tools for discussion, online voting collaborative mapping, as well as events linked to various campaigns involving public consultation. Simultaneously, to improve Europe’s role in the business of in-situ monitoring, LandSense will create sustainable business models to support market uptake and innovation of its novel added-value products and services.",

They are rewarded  with a digital currency that is spent in the Heerlen economy. This will benefit the city, its inhabitants and its entrepreneurs. The approach is centralised around the development of a new digital platform, applying Blockchain technology. With this platform, citizens can perform tasks for the municipality of Heerlen with a rewarding system. This digital platform contains 3 main features: a mobile application for citizens (to find tasks and commit to a task), a web application for entrepreneurs (to receive payments) and a municipal dashboard to upload and control tasks. These tasks for instance are maintaining a small piece of the urban space. The reward takes the form of a local digital currency, so that it can only be issued within the local economy of the municipality of Heerlen. It is important to note that although the idea originated from the perspective of the public space (while tasks that first mainly focus on maintenance), the concept should be applicable to several other domains (safety, prevention or care).",

        "description": "SPRO is a new free mobile app for professionals working in the urban distribution of goods (DUM) to be able to park in loading and unloading spaces in the city and the metropolitan area. The purpose of the app is to unify and improve the way this type of parking is managed. Users simply need to select the area and enter the DUM code for the zone. The codes can be found on street signs and once entered they entitle the user to 30 minutes of free parking. In Barcelona, vehicles classified as zero emissions get 30 additional minutes. There is also now the possibility of getting personalised alerts and notifications when regulated parking time is close to expiring. SPRO also enables users to locate DUM places easily thanks to a geolocation system, and to check the expected occupancy and regulated hours for each zone. It’s also possible to check all the parking operations and data for each vehicle, whether the parking is for personal use or in relation to a business account. The app includes a system to forecast the availability of free regulated spaces in Barcelona, helping users to find a specific place for loading and unloading. By introducing the destination and expected time of arrival, the app displays an availability forecast: areas with plenty of available spaces are in green, while areas with average availability are in amber and those with very limited availability are in red.",

Positium, who partnered with WSP Finland for this project, used innovative data sources and combinations to tackle the city's problems (e.g. old routes system, with mostly circular lines, ...). Positium was responsible for collecting and preparing mobile positioning and other data to for creating an efficient bus route network. People’s mobility is complex, thus the company used over 20 layers of data to create this new network, including data on mobility, planning, bus routes, and land use. Such an approach was chosen to get a thorough overview of where people live, where they go, and how they get from A to B. Several other data sets were combined with the above-mentioned data, such as information about work and home locations from the Estonian Tax and Customs Board, different data layers from the Land Board, home addresses of school- and kindergarten children, locations of service facilities, and strategic documents concerning transportation and land use planning. Using data from previous design process steps, they evaluated three alternatives, the old bus line network and two new alternative networks, in terms of operation costs, number of buses needed, speed, travel times, accessibility, emissions. One of the project’s goals was to use qualitative data in the form of citizen feedback to complement the quantitative analysis that was based on mobile phone data. When designing complex systems for society it is necessary to understand the users’ point of view as well. The feedback cast light on several socially important aspects that complemented the previous data-driven analysis.",

By providing tools to simulate different scenarios of future changes in land-use, the project supports the authorities for smart, dynamic and sustainable planning. This sustainable future should assess the risks related to population growth in order to reduce or mitigate these risks for the citizens. Current and predicted population density maps will strengthen risks models values in Wallonia:\n- Better estimates of current risks\n- Better policies making and sustainable spatial planning\n- Better long term and dynamic risk management\nThe results presented in this paper will be compared to previous simulation to prove their adding value. However, first results of the risks maps illustrate the issues of the MAUP and future research should be carried out to increase the spatial quality of socio-economic vulnerability in the model. This project makes use of existing ICT and scientific methods to have a common spatial planning model in Wallonia and Flanders.

The well-known Whim app by MaaS Global, for example, launched in Helsinki back in 2016, and has since spread to other countries.\n- Maritime Solutions: areas of development include a for-profit peer-to-peer platform for on-demand boat rides, autonomous vessels, increasingly automated data transfer, a smart channel, remote control of vessels and smart port logistics.",

The council’s internal mapping software, used by more than 700 council employees and partners, was an older system that was no longer well supported. \nLike most councils, Torfaen also strived to provide location-based information through its public website. Putting services on an interactive map helps residents resolve their enquiries faster and reduces the burden on the council’s call centre staff. With the support of Precisely, using Spectrum Spatial, the council is now able to have a continuosuly updated map, used both by citizens and public sector stakeholders, that is also easy to be used by council's employee.",

The not-for-profit organisation is using ArcGIS to encourage stakeholders to improve the quality of riverside habitats and reopen fish migratory routes that have been blocked for decades. The organisation used ArcGIS Desktop to create an interactive ‘roadmap’ of the Greater Thames Estuary, combining data on fish migrations, habitat quality, artificial river barriers, flood areas and riverside developments.  It then created a website using ArcGIS Hub to display the web map and made it publicly available online:\n- An interactive web app allows users to explore data on fish migratory routes, river barriers and habitats along the Thames and its tributaries;\n-An engaging Story Map provides people with an interactive tour of the Thames, incorporating maps, images, video and information;\n-Esri training resources and free online courses enabled Thames Estuary Partnership to optimise its use of ArcGIS with no external support.",

Used by 200 employees, the ArcGIS-based solution enabled the company to improve the accuracy of its water leakage data, increase the effectiveness of its leakage detection activities and target significant increases in revenue. Using Esri’s ArcGIS Online and Collector App for ArcGIS, Severn Trent Water created a mobile app that allows employees to view the recorded locations of all void properties on an interactive map on their smartphones. All of the data collected via the mobile app is uploaded in real-time to an Esri Dashboard, where managers can visualise the survey results.",

This small team assesses requirements and requests, gathers business analysis and provides user support while building interactive dashboards and web and mobile apps for internal and external use. Fire prevention is a core function of the Fire & Rescue Service and is the way in which the Council reduces demand on its services and helps to protect its residents. Safe and Well visits are a key part of prevention work, where firefighters make visits to vulnerable residents to decrease the risk of fire in their homes. Previously, assessment data obtained during home visits had been recorded straight onto spreadsheets, an unwieldy and time-consuming process. This also created a challenge for privacy purposes: LGTBQ+ data needs to be collected anonymously. A more sophisticated but simple-to-use self-service digital approach was needed, ensuring complete anonymity, while giving the Council the data it requires to ensure the services it provides to its residents is inclusive to those of all identities and sexual orientations.",

To further develop its approach, Uthey first used algorithms in ArcGIS Pro to analyse a database of 21,000 crimes and identify where the most crime was taking place, in the fewest locations. While the force had used ArcGIS before to show crime hot spots, its new, more advanced spatial analysis enables police officers to pinpoint the fewest locations where the most crimes take place and therefore identify policing priorities with a previously-unattainable level of precision. Next, Cthey used ArcGIS Pro to analyse the relative harm caused by each individual crime, using the Cambridge Crime Harm Index as a way of measuring the severity of crimes. This spatial analysis revealed only a handful of 50m2 locations with a high proportion of serious crime and gave police officers unequivocal evidence of the areas where it should focus its activities, for the first time. They then used ArcGIS to develop interactive story maps to make all of its new intelligence about priority policing areas and harmful crime accessible to police officers in a format that is easy for them to understand. Officers working on the beat now use these story maps on mobile devices to get instant access to information on specific crimes in their locations, right when they need it.",

The Park Authority’s role is to conserve and enhance this precious environment, and to help people understand and enjoy it. When the organisation began to plan a major exhibition, it started looking for inventive new ways to help it engage more successfully with visitors. It decided to showcase the technology that it uses every day in the management of the park and took the bold decision to make its geospatial data and tools available for members of the public to explore for themselves. This ground-breaking use of GIS augmented visitors’ interest in the biodiversity and archaeology of the park and gave them a deeper appreciation of how and why the organisation implements vital conservation schemes. Visitors learn now about different bee species and identify archaeological features using interactive Esri Dashboards. They can also engage with an ArcGIS Story Map to interpret drone photography and identify unrecorded archaeology.",

To provide a safe and positive experience for passengers, the airport’s employees need to work together to manage and maintain 35,000 assets, with a replacement value of €4 billion, as well as collect, share and analyse a vast amount of operational data. Esri’s ArcGIS is now being deployed as part of a wide-ranging digital transformation initiative to enhance the passenger experience. The use of ArcGIS on mobile devices, on interactive management dashboards and for complex analysis is leading to improvements in operational efficiency, risk management and safety throughout the airport. Nowadays field-based employees use ArcGIS mobile solutions to check the conditions of 1,700,000m² of airfield. Pavement managers use Esri dashboards to monitor maintenance activities in real time. Analysts use ArcGIS and AcrPro to gain a deeper understanding of critical issues, including runway usage.",

Yet extreme weather like this can no longer be assumed to be a rare occurrence. According to some estimates, the frequency of storms and severe rainfall events in winter and autumn in Ireland could increase by up to 30 per cent. Recognising the risk to its local communities, Cork County Council wanted to improve its ability to monitor and communicate the impact of extreme weather events on its road network. It sought to collate information about roads blocked by flood, fallen trees and heavy snowfall and provide this information in near real-time to council teams, in an easily understood way, so that they could respond more effectively, learn from past events and improve communication to the public. The general public and emergency responders have now up-to-date information about potential hazards, while emergency teams have a clearer understanding of unfolding events during a severe weather emergency. Finally, the council can look back over previous crises to see patterns and identify areas for improvement.",

Much of the information it requires – such as the locations of special areas of conservation and flood risks – is held centrally within the council’s geographic information system (GIS). Planning officers use GIS to analyse the locations of proposed developments and identify any potential development conflicts quickly and easily. The council realised, however, that there was a lot of local knowledge about Donegal not accessible via its GIS. Communities, families and individuals have knowledge about buildings, fields and even hedgerows. The council consequently wanted to find a way to capture this ‘micro-knowledge’ within GIS, so that it could be taken into account at an earlier stage in the planning process. Through this crowdsourcing, citizens play now a greater role in the planning process as their views and knowledge are captured and Planning Officers make more efficient and better informed decisions about planning applications.",

The county is predominantly rural and covers a large area of 2,074 square miles.  In common with all departments within the council, the SEN transportation team was under pressure to reduce its operating costs and downscale its budget (£10 million), but its priority none-the-less remained the same: to provide safe and secure journeys for vulnerable young people. Now Norfolk County Council is using Esri’s ArcGIS platform to help arranging the most suitable school transportation for pupils with special educational needs. Employees have better understanding of pupils’ travel needs, while the council can easily see opportunities for pupils to share journeys or make shorter journeys to reduce travel costs. Efficiency savings from the use of the app contributes to the SEN team’s £500,000 cost reduction target.",

But, as most local authorities in the UK will attest, it can be difficult to attract and sustain the attention of these external audiences. Using configurable apps from Esri, South Ayrshire Council has developed over 25 informative Story Maps to communicate information to citizens, businesses and its own employees.  These highly versatile, interactive maps don’t just tell a story; they engage people in local issues, support the local economy and improve the efficiency of council operations.",

So, when Carlow County Council was required to merge with Carlow Town Council in 2014, this significant reorganisation provided precisely the catalyst needed for a brand new approach to managing planning applications. Therefore Carlow has used Esri’s ArcGIS platform to transform its planning application system and deliver a high quality of service for citizens. Planners are now saving time thanks to automated GIS analysis capabilities while the council has better information to support faster, well informed planning decisions.

        "description": "Europe’s Largest Port Prepares for Autonomous Ships. The Dutch city of Rotterdam is home to one of the oldest and largest ports in the world. The Port of Rotterdam stretches 26 miles near and along the River Maas, docks more than 140,000 vessels each year, and handles 461 million tons of cargo annually. In a world where autonomous cars already navigate the roads in several countries, the goal is to be ready when similar transportation technology takes to the water by a fusion of high-tech applications ranging from artificial intelligence to location intelligence powered by a modern geographic information system (GIS). It is part of the a total digital transformation of the Port of Rotterdam, with crews already installing sensors throughout the complex on land and in the water. Locations include berths, quay walls, roads, workstations—anywhere that might affect the efficiency and safety of the port. The real-time devices, powered by the Internet of Things (IoT), will take in all types of data, including water temperatures, tidal conditions, the salinity of the sea, water currents, wind direction and speed, loading and unloading operations, and what berth space is available and when. The information will be parsed by a program capable of real-time, big data analysis.",

The need to increase the information assets of the managed infrastructures, to disseminate information to all staff, to equip themselves with cutting-edge technologies that allow integration between the various company systems and the dissemination of data in the field, has pushed the company to the technological renewal of its GIS system. The new GAIA GIS system, based on Italia on Esri technology, manages data relating to water, sewage and industrial networks through a desktop component, for updating and complex analysis; a web component, for the dissemination of information within the GAIA intranet; and a mobile component to help the staff in the field. The GIS system, in all its components, is integrated with the Maximo EAM Asset Management software. The integration facilitates the management of the information of the infrastructures common to the two systems and allows the geo-referencing of the work orders of failure of the networks. Furthermore, the new system has been set up to allow future integrations with other company systems.",

The shared data and video images provide a holistic picture of the situation. By comparing real-time data with historical data, assumptions can be made about the further course of the situation. This makes it possible to anticipate and prevent potential problems. In addition, a so-called Common Operational Picture has been realized. In this dashboard, the pressures for the various mobility flows are displayed in real time. In this way, all the different parties involved have an overview of the current status at a glance. In this way, the operational staff, from transport providers to road authorities and the police, can act immediately to remedy and even prevent the bottlenecks.",

Staatsbosbeheer supported the development of a special instrument with lets you see which green and blue spots can be found in the immediate vicinity of your home or workspace. The paper-based map offers a unique sensory experience which cannot be reproduced digitally. This big map – covering more than one square meter of information on both sides of the paper needs to be discovered to really learn to appreciate it. It is a cartographic gem that shows urban nature in the city and its surroundings.

With evolving needs in the transportation sector the challenge that the administration is facing is utilizing digitized assets efficiently and investing in strategic conservation methods for the road network infrastructure. Therefore the Bavarian State Ministry of Housing, Building and Transport created, with a team of data scientists at Supper & Supper, an AI proof-of-concept model that predicts wear and tear on a highly trafficked highway connecting multiple cities and towns in southern Germany, so that road maintenance can be efficiently planned at the proper time and location based on highway conditions. A technology stack of ArcGIS Pro and open source Python frameworks was utilized to access, wrangle, impute, analyze, and visualize data and results. The final results were then published and visualized in ArcGIS Pro, with each road section symbolized to illustrate where road unevenness and cracks would likely develop over time.",

Fewer and fewer people wanted to come to the pub street as a consequence of all too many stories about aggressiveness on the street. The municipality decided to intervene via a living lab for crowd control, looking over large groups of people. The street is now full of high-tech material for collecting data. The project is now entering its final phase and the time of data collection and writing algorithms slowly passes into the period of actual use.",

For example one 3m x 3m square at East Northamptonshire Council’s Cedar Drive office can be identified more precisely as ‘Corded.Clean.Eased’ as opposed to ENC’s postcode of NN14 4LZ which covers a larger area.

No more buying tickets at ticket machines, no more searching for the right tariff zone and the cheapest ticket - simply check in via Tickin and start travelling. Checking out at the destination is done automatically by Tickin. For this, the customer pays the VRN eTariff, which is calculated from the linear distance between the starting point and the destination. In addition to the simple and convenient ticket purchase, there is another major advantage: tickets are checked contactless on the trains as well as on the buses and trams. Billing takes initially place via PayPal, with other payment methods to follow shortly. ",

These maps show movement of the ground with mm/year accuracy, which can be used to identify potential hazards for rail networks such as landslides. SatSense takes readings from radar satellite and converts it to high resolution ground movement. The Sentinel-1 constellation consists of two radarbearing satellites, which between them return to the same orbit every six days and acquire a new radar image. Sophisticated processing of these images using proprietary SatSense algorithms, which build on a technique known as InSAR, produces detailed maps of ground movement between satellite passes. These maps show movement either towards or away from the satellite and by combining images acquired from different geometries, horizontal and vertical motion can be derived. SatSense algorithms build on academic algorithms developed by founders Andy Hooper and Tim Wright, Professors at the University of Leeds, and in particular on new algorithms that allow us to robustly separate signal from noise at high spatial resolution data (InSAR).

In the pilot, Deutsche Bahn will equip a Hamburg S-Bahn train with innovative sensors that locate the train and monitor surroundings, which can be localised on the HD map, which effectively creates a digital twin of the railway. An important component for the Sensors4Rail pilot project is an HD map, a digital map of high-definition quality. It enables the train to pinpoint itself precisely on the tracks, and recognise and classify obstacles by sensing and surveying its surroundings. These can be accurately localised on the HD map so that in the future, the train control centre can react even faster. Ultimately, this technology set-up will enable Deutsche Bahn to increase the capacity by keeping more trains running on the tracks simultaneously. In effect, the map becomes the digital twin of the railway and its immediate surroundings. Through its location platform, HERE provides Deutsche Bahn with a private development environment to independently manage its data. The data remain fully under the ownership and control of Deutsche Bahn.",

We test the use of drones on a site where new tourist facilities will be established to set a baseline to identify future changes. We demonstrate how drones could help protected area management by monitoring visitor use pat-terns and commonly associated impacts such as trail condition (width and depth), vegetation structure and disturbances, informal trail proliferation, tram-pling, and trash and other impacts along the trails. The accuracy and reliability was assessed, compared with intensive ﬁeld measurements of impacts and found low-cost drones to be effective in mapping the study area with a resolution of 0.5 cm/pixel: drone derived trail measurements were comparable to traditional measurements with a negligible divergence on trail width measurements and a consistent1.05 cm divergence on trail depth measurements that can be corrected with a few validation points. In addition, a high-resolution vegetation classiﬁcation map that could be used as a baseline for monitoring impacts was created. It was concluded that drones can effectively contribute to visitor monitoring by reducing time spent in the ﬁeld and by providing high-resolution time series that could be used as baseline to measure tourism impacts on conservation values in protected areas.",

For this reason, Tourism and Planning of the Costa del Sol, a body dependent on the Provincial Council of Malaga, faced one of its greatest challenges in 2020: managing the capacity of its beaches. Two solutions were developed. Firstly, a total capacity control solution to control the total capacity of each of the beaches, taking into account various indicators related to the location, the bathers and the surroundings of the beaches. Based on this, a map of the real space of the bathers was obtained. From there, they only had to calculate the capacity according to the regulations of each municipality, which could have as a reference the 2 metres of interpersonal distance recommended by the Central Government, but which in some municipalities was increased to 12 metres to take into account the characteristics of the bathers who used to go to these beaches. Secondly, there is the monitoring: A pilot project was launched with two town councils aimed at monitoring the situation of each beach in real time and through a control panel. One of these municipalities was Mijas, one of the most touristic municipalities on the Costa del Sol.",

At the start of Britain’s COVID-19 measures, Ordnance Survey (OS) used its Points of Interest and OS Highways data to help identify safe and accessible locations for a mobile team to take blood samples. This meant they could monitor patients’ health safely and easily, away from the busy hospital. Supermarkets with car parks were a clear choice. OS mixed different datasets to show all supermarket locations and their footprints along with nearby car parks. Then the NHS Lothian GIS team narrowed the selection based on size, location, and likelihood of getting agreement from the supermarket. The team prioritised spaces that had already been used for other mobile health services – such as breast cancer screening. NHS Lothian combined the locations with anonymised patient addresses – converted to coordinates and displayed using MapInfo software and a range of OS products (Points of Interest, OS Highways, and Open Map Local). From this, we could identify the best places to support these vulnerable patients. OS gave its information under our well-established Mapping for Emergencies protocol – here to support Britain in times of crisis.",

Almost a quarter of Year Six children are officially obese, with statistics directly linking takeaways close to schools to high levels of obesity. By using Ordnance Survey’s OS Street View, Birmingham’s Public Health team could produce a map showing the high number of takeaways near schools across the city. As well as providing valuable information, the map is easy to share and has given headteachers and planning departments the data to support opposition to applications for new fast food outlets near schools. Following the development of this easy to use map: (1) The spread of unhealthy fast food outlets around schools has significantly slowed, (2) the local planning department has adopted a policy to limit the number of new fast food outlets, and (3) since the policy, almost half of applications for new takeaways have been denied.

Public Sector Mapping Agreement (PSMA) data from Ordnance Survey provided critical evidence leading to Somerset CCG keeping stroke services at both Yeovil and Taunton hospitals. The South West Commissioning Support (SWCS) Unit’s Geographical Information System (GIS) team used innovative analytical techniques with MapInfo Professional, RouteFinder and Basemap’s TRACC system – designed to quickly and accurately calculate various travel times. Maps and reports were produced showing travel access times to the two current hospital sites at Taunton and Yeovil. These included blue light emergency transport times, private and public transport options, population numbers within travel times, and locations of stroke cases.",

        "description": "The Belfast City Council is piloting a mobile phone app that rewards users for spending time in a local park. The free Civic Dollars app will track users’ locations and reward them for each half hour spent in Connswater Community Greenway, a linear park following the course of three rivers through east Belfast, with a daily limit. The city plans to add other parks during the pilot, which runs from 1 June to 31 August. The resulting ‘dollars’ can be spent on transport passes and tickets to visitor attractions. They can also be donated to community groups in the city, which can use them for services including business training and professional advice. The app has been developed by Ballymena-based Moai Digital. The Civic Dollars app also provides a promotional platform for local businesses, services and events – and the insights we’ll gather will help us to better understand how people use green spaces, improve park management, reduce vandalism, littering and anti-social behaviour and enhance the visitor experience. The pilot is part of Belfast City Council’s ‘Amazing spaces, smart places’ programme, for which it ran a funding competition with the Northern Ireland Department of Justice in 2018.",

The pilots were aimed to design and test what a mapping platform could look like to help asset owners, such as telecommunication, energy and water companies and local authorities securely share their existing underground asset data with authorised users. Early research identified two suitable areas for launching pilots: (1) in the north east of England, the North East Underground Infrastructure Hub (NEUIHub) was created following Northumbrian Water Group’s 2018 Innovation Festival, and (2) in London, the Highways Apparatus Data Exchange System (HADES), an early proof of concept, was initiated in 2017.",

The AIRbezen project is a clever word pun on the Flemish of Antwerp dialect word for strawberries (jarrebezen) and, obviously, the word air. By examining the leaves of strawberry plants, AIRbezen maps the air quality of a city or province. Strawberry plants are distributed among families, schools or associations, who give the plant a place on the windowsill. After 2 months the strawberry-hosts cut off a few leaves and bring them in at the distribution points. The researchers at the University of Antwerp then measure the concentrations of particulate matter on the leaves, thus revealing to what the plant was exposed.",

With the IoT platform SAP Leonardo IoT, Heidelberg can better plan the routes of waste collection vehicles. Together with SAP Digital Business Services, the Digital Agentur Heidelberg and other partners, the city of Heidelberg installed ultrasonic sensors in the containers. The sensors record the fill level of the containers in real time and transmit this information hourly to the backend in the SAP Cloud Platform via the long-range radio technology LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network). In this way the waste disposal company knows exactly when which container needs to be emptied. In addition, the collected data can be further processed. Using the SAP Waste and Recycling Management System, managers can create further analyses to predict waste quantities at peak times and adjust the effort required for disposal accordingly. In the future, the city wants to digitally network other infrastructures together with SAP. The potential for smartification of district heating shafts, electricity and water meters, grit silos or in building management, for example, is great.",

When a citizen walks on the Beacon Mile and has the app installed on its smartphone the beacon will emit signals. The emitted signals will then be decoded by the smartphone. The beacons are located in different places along the Beacon Mile. Furthermore, the signal will then be transformed into the pre-programmed message. The message sent to the user will appear as a pop up on the smartphone. It can contain important information, discounts or to help to discover the route. Most importantly, the city of Amsterdam has been showing a lot of progress in their journey to become a smart city. The city’s local government stimulates different innovative projects.

For two years, the train will be tested on the track between Aulnoye and Busigny, during the school holidays. Outside the research and test periods, the train will be in regular commercial service, transporting passengers. During these regular trips in conventional driving mode, the train will record data that will improve the performance of the signal recognition algorithms. For example,  by detecting the colour of the traffic lights and the surrounding environment of the train. At the same time, laboratory work is being carried out on trial simulators at the sites of all the consortium partners to fine-tune the itineraries of the test train and further develop the automated system.

It is inspired by and builds further on two previous CurieuzeNeuzen projects organized in the City of Antwerp (“CurieuzeNeuzen Antwerp”) and the Flemish Region (“CurieuzeNeuzen Vlaanderen”). These projects examine the air quality of citizens in their streets, by collecting nitrogen dioxide concentrations on a large scale and making available these air quality to the general public. Volunteering citizens and organizations attached a simple measuring device to the outside of a window on the street side, through which they measured the concentration of NO2 throughout an entire month.
