        "description": "Mobile positioning data can increase our understanding of movements in society and for businesses it helps map the locations of its customers. Positium positions itself between the client and mobile network operator to analyze Big Data of mobile phone locations, providing clients with faster and more cost-effective analysis based on a large population rather than a sample. There are multiple domains where such data is directly relevant. The objective of the business plan is to conduct domain-specific market research, assess the requirements for development of the technology and specify the business model for Positium Data Mediator – a product to extract, process and deliver the insights from mobile big data to users globally. At current stage, Positium Data Mediator works in Estonia in domains like urban planning, transportation planning, geo-marketing, tourism statistics. Positium is transforming from a global market leader in its home market to a global player in multiple markets in the EU and emerging countries. The business plan will be vital to narrow down the focus for expansion and determine strategies to pick the low-hanging fruit. In the business plan, the selection of domains, geographical regions and development requirements will be investigated using surveys and interviews among potential customers, market research and financial calculations. The outcome of the business plan is a recommendation on the geographic expansion, business model and the need for technology development, and a business plan.",

        "description": "Urban environments are awash with data from fixed and mobile sensors and monitoring infrastructures from public, private, or industry sources. Making such data useful would enable developing novel big data applications to benefit the citizens of Europe in areas such as transportation, infrastructures, and crime prevention. Urban data is heterogeneous, noisy, and unlabeled, which severely reduces its usability. The goal of the VaVel project is to radically advance our ability to use urban data in applications that can identify and address citizen needs and improve urban life. Our motivation comes from problems in urban transportation. This project will develop a general purpose framework for managing and mining multiple heterogeneous urban data streams for cities become more efficient, productive and resilient. The framework will be able to solve major issues that arise with urban transportation related data and are currently not dealt by existing stream management technologies. The project brings together two European cities that provide diverse large scale data of cross-country origin and real application needs, three major European companies in this space, and a strong group of researchers that have uniquely strong expertise in analyzing real-life urban data. VaVel aims at making fundamental advances in addressing the most critical inefficiencies of current (big) data management and stream frameworks to cope with emerging urban sensor data thus making European urban data more accessible and easy to use and enhancing European industries that use big data management and analytics. The consortium develops end-user driven concrete scenaria that are addressing real, important problems with the potential of enormous impact, and a large spectrum of technology requirements, thus enabling the realization of the fundamental capabilities required and the realistic evaluation of the success of our methods.",

The groups range from first responders, local authorities and security forces to media companies and event planners. xR4DRAMA's methodology is based on X Reality (XR) technologies, and the tool can be used remotely and on site for an augmented and shared perception of a given situation. The aim of this project is to help first responders and media companies to have all the necessary information before planning any actions. xR4DRAMA aims at enhancing situation awareness through, especially, XR technologies in order to: \n• facilitate the sourcing of all relevant information needed to plan necessary actions; \n• create an 'as if on site' experience of an environment (e.g. in VR) to anticipate the planned event or an incident as thoroughly as possible;\n• create a joint understanding of an environment (a “distributed situation awareness”) to be shared by team members, allowing for smoother communication and consultation;\n• provide the possibility to continuously update the representation of the location (e.g. in VR) during the evolving incident/event in order to understand and potentially re-assess consequences of specific decisions.\nxR4DRAMA will use XR technologies and integrated systems fed with live sensor data in order to anticipate situations as accurately as possible, so that decisions can be made as informed and efficient as possible. xR4DRAMA aims at creating a tool for multiple domains, from outdoor media production planning to disaster management. It can be used remotely and on site for an augmented and shared perception of a given situation, in order to facilitate more efficient and resource-saving planning as well as a frictionless implementation of the planned action.",

        "description": "Transportation authorities use real-time traffic data for everyday urban transport management, and analyse commuters’ origin and destination points for infrastructure and transit planning. However, intelligent transport systems that provide real-time data cost millions of euros for road sensor deployment. GPS aggregators like Google Maps and Inrix are inexpensive but can miss up to 50% of real time traffic jams, and do not represent population segments proportionally, which is essential to transportation planning. Cellular network location data is now ubiquitous and cheap, but it is imprecise due to the range of cellular antenna coverage. Cellint uses artificial intelligence algorithms to process cellular network location data for optimized transportation management. Their patented technology tracks phones on a mobile network passively and anonymously, pinpointing their locations on any mode of transportation. The result is a virtual sensor network that provides real-time sensor-quality traffic data at a fraction of the cost of sensor systems. The project is to upgrade and integrate current solutions into a single automated transportation information platform with advanced analysis and visualization features, with results provided in minutes instead of months.",

The Vehicle sharing operators are the prime customers of SMASH. They are proliferating worldwide, but their deployed systems are currently characterized by poor interoperability, service coverage restricted to the center of the cities, and poor capability to dynamically extend fleets. Peer-to-peer (P2P) vehicle-sharing is a key market for SMASH. P2P is a process expanding worldwide, whereby existing vehicle owners make their vehicles available for others to rent for short periods of time. The participating car owners are able to charge a fee to rent out their vehicles when they are not using them. The Participating renters can access nearby and affordable vehicles and pay only a convenient fee, for the time they need to use them. SMASH, bringing the two parties together enables a global expanding community of users and available resources. SMASH enables Open Source vehicle sharing. In the next future, thanks to SMASH users will be able to choose and access a wide and expanding range of vehicles, with a smart access and reliable pay-per-use. Many heterogeneous and interoperable vehicles will be connected and available in sharing.",

        "description": "Sustainable cultural tourism policies can significantly support the development of the European regions. Cultural tourism, especially in rural areas as well as in urban periphery, can emerge as a factor of economic growth. The EU-funded SmartCulTour project intends to redefine the concept of cultural tourism to provide European regions with strategies that engage stakeholders in co-creating smart cultural tourism practices. The project will develop a decision-support system that will extensively monitor the regions through a combination of traditional and non-traditional data sources. Inclusive desk research will find which sustainable cultural tourism policies have a positive impact and will formulate proposals for eventual local interventions. The project will be deployed through field tests in six living labs.",

Its goal is to contribute towards urban policy agendas that take tourism and its social effects seriously. Specifically, the project will analyse tourism mobilities and mobile dwelling as transformative force-fields for places. It will also excavate social exclusion issues and coping practices through engagement with affected communities in case study cities. Another task is the development of CityLabs as sites for the design of people-based and place-based solutions.",

Through Mirador you can consult maps, data and photos in an agile and attractive way. The Diputación de Sevilla , with the collaboration of the University of Seville and the work of several cutting-edge companies in the sector, has been working since 2007 on an ambitious research project in new information and communication technologies to develop the System of Local Information of the Province of Seville (SIL). Based on the Local Infrastructure and Facilities Survey promoted by the Ministry of Territorial Policy, and following the guidelines of the Junta de Andalucía regarding spatial information management, an intense work has been carried out on methodological definition, computer development and continuous updating of data. Mirador is the visible part of this System and allows to know the infrastructures, equipment and services of most of the municipalities included in the EIEL. Mirador offers numerous possibilities to discover varied information about population, planning, roads, educational, cultural, sports centers, open spaces, and much more. Mirador is a Map viewer , an exhaustive collection of Data and a Gallery of Photos , which takes advantage of all the power of the SIL spatial databases to offer you a model of the provincial territory in the 'Maps' tab on which to carry out your searches and inquiries.",

        "description": "SPRO is a new free mobile app for professionals working in the urban distribution of goods (DUM) to be able to park in loading and unloading spaces in the city and the metropolitan area. The purpose of the app is to unify and improve the way this type of parking is managed. Users simply need to select the area and enter the DUM code for the zone. The codes can be found on street signs and once entered they entitle the user to 30 minutes of free parking. In Barcelona, vehicles classified as zero emissions get 30 additional minutes. There is also now the possibility of getting personalised alerts and notifications when regulated parking time is close to expiring. SPRO also enables users to locate DUM places easily thanks to a geolocation system, and to check the expected occupancy and regulated hours for each zone. It’s also possible to check all the parking operations and data for each vehicle, whether the parking is for personal use or in relation to a business account. The app includes a system to forecast the availability of free regulated spaces in Barcelona, helping users to find a specific place for loading and unloading. By introducing the destination and expected time of arrival, the app displays an availability forecast: areas with plenty of available spaces are in green, while areas with average availability are in amber and those with very limited availability are in red.",

        "description": "The city sought to design a new transportation network. Positium, who partnered with WSP Finland for this project, used innovative data sources and combinations to tackle the city's problems (e.g. old routes system, with mostly circular lines, ...). Positium was responsible for collecting and preparing mobile positioning and other data to for creating an efficient bus route network. People’s mobility is complex, thus the company used over 20 layers of data to create this new network, including data on mobility, planning, bus routes, and land use. Such an approach was chosen to get a thorough overview of where people live, where they go, and how they get from A to B. Several other data sets were combined with the above-mentioned data, such as information about work and home locations from the Estonian Tax and Customs Board, different data layers from the Land Board, home addresses of school- and kindergarten children, locations of service facilities, and strategic documents concerning transportation and land use planning. Using data from previous design process steps, they evaluated three alternatives, the old bus line network and two new alternative networks, in terms of operation costs, number of buses needed, speed, travel times, accessibility, emissions. One of the project’s goals was to use qualitative data in the form of citizen feedback to complement the quantitative analysis that was based on mobile phone data. When designing complex systems for society it is necessary to understand the users’ point of view as well. The feedback cast light on several socially important aspects that complemented the previous data-driven analysis.",

By providing tools to simulate different scenarios of future changes in land-use, the project supports the authorities for smart, dynamic and sustainable planning. This sustainable future should assess the risks related to population growth in order to reduce or mitigate these risks for the citizens. Current and predicted population density maps will strengthen risks models values in Wallonia:\n- Better estimates of current risks\n- Better policies making and sustainable spatial planning\n- Better long term and dynamic risk management\nThe results presented in this paper will be compared to previous simulation to prove their adding value. However, first results of the risks maps illustrate the issues of the MAUP and future research should be carried out to increase the spatial quality of socio-economic vulnerability in the model. This project makes use of existing ICT and scientific methods to have a common spatial planning model in Wallonia and Flanders. A national land-use change model is seen as a key asset for sustainable spatial planning. Homogenizing risks studies between regions is intended since natural hazards are not stopped by regional borders.' (Stephenne et al. 2016)",

The mobility pilot will be based on a taxi/ride-sharing service provided by Taxiway. A fleet of 20 taxis will collect passengers from the Thessaloniki suburbs and provide a return trip to the city centre. To concentrate trips in as few vehicles as possible the origin and destination of each journey will be recorded throughout the trial period. The taxis will work on a flat rate basis, mostly funded by the project. After Galileo For Mobility, the service provision will continue and the number of taxis will increase, while the costs will be covered through MaaS credits purchased by Taxiway users.",

This small team assesses requirements and requests, gathers business analysis and provides user support while building interactive dashboards and web and mobile apps for internal and external use. Fire prevention is a core function of the Fire & Rescue Service and is the way in which the Council reduces demand on its services and helps to protect its residents. Safe and Well visits are a key part of prevention work, where firefighters make visits to vulnerable residents to decrease the risk of fire in their homes. Previously, assessment data obtained during home visits had been recorded straight onto spreadsheets, an unwieldy and time-consuming process. This also created a challenge for privacy purposes: LGTBQ+ data needs to be collected anonymously. A more sophisticated but simple-to-use self-service digital approach was needed, ensuring complete anonymity, while giving the Council the data it requires to ensure the services it provides to its residents is inclusive to those of all identities and sexual orientations.",

The team developed the WaterSource Portal, which was initially trialled in November 2018 and quickly adopted 24/7/365 as a business-critical system, taking data out of spreadsheets and sharing it online, through web services, on maps and dashboards. Data from multiple sources is stored in its Microsoft SQL server database acting as the data store for ArcGIS Enterprise, which collates, analyses, records and manages spatial data to identify and predict issues affecting raw water quality. Portal for ArcGIS acts as the ‘one stop shop’ for the team’s GIS needs, enabling them to create, use and share maps and apps with colleagues and external stakeholders.",

        "description": "For many years, City of London Police has used Esri’s ArcGIS platform to help it analyse patterns in crime and plan policing responses. To further develop its approach, Uthey first used algorithms in ArcGIS Pro to analyse a database of 21,000 crimes and identify where the most crime was taking place, in the fewest locations. While the force had used ArcGIS before to show crime hot spots, its new, more advanced spatial analysis enables police officers to pinpoint the fewest locations where the most crimes take place and therefore identify policing priorities with a previously-unattainable level of precision. Next, Cthey used ArcGIS Pro to analyse the relative harm caused by each individual crime, using the Cambridge Crime Harm Index as a way of measuring the severity of crimes. This spatial analysis revealed only a handful of 50m2 locations with a high proportion of serious crime and gave police officers unequivocal evidence of the areas where it should focus its activities, for the first time. They then used ArcGIS to develop interactive story maps to make all of its new intelligence about priority policing areas and harmful crime accessible to police officers in a format that is easy for them to understand. Officers working on the beat now use these story maps on mobile devices to get instant access to information on specific crimes in their locations, right when they need it.",

Sourcing homecare packages for vulnerable clients is one of the Council’s key transformation projects, finding suitable care and building capacity for its most vulnerable clients so they can live safely in their own homes. The adult social care team now use an ArcGIS web map to see where existing clients who are receiving care are located, overlain with new clients waiting to come out of hospital or needing care at home. Workers can use My Nearest functionality and alternatively filter by care supplier, by contract type and view other information eg social care locality or whether the client is in a flood risk area. The app helps workers immediately understand any current situation giving them the ability to have more incisive conversations with colleagues and care providers.",

The first tool uses Esri’s Survey123 for ArcGIS to allow workers to collect information about new community-based services using their mobile devices, while they are in the field. The second tool allows the council to control what data is shared among the Adult Social Care teams, as well as add supplementary information that may be helpful for potential service users.

You can see where, when and how you can find refreshment on such days in this map. It shows you for every hour from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., where it tends to be rather cool, where there is usually a fresh breeze and where there is currently shade. Due to the differentiated topography, there can be considerable differences within the urban area. You can also discover refreshing places such as swimming areas, drinking fountains and parks. With one click on the share function you can share your new favorite place with others.",
